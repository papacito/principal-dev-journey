# principal-dev-journey

> A structured journey toward becoming a Principal / Staff Engineer —  
> blending deep technical mastery, system design, performance engineering, and leadership.

This repository is my public learning path as I move beyond the Senior Developer level into high-impact architecture and engineering leadership.  
It documents what I study, build, and experiment with — from advanced JVM internals to distributed system design, performance tuning, and organizational influence.

## Goal

To master the technical depth, architectural vision, and cross-team influence expected from a modern Principal Engineer.

This roadmap focuses on four pillars:

| Pillar | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Technical Mastery | Deep understanding of the Java platform, concurrency, performance, and memory models. |
| Systems & Architecture | Designing scalable, reliable, and observable distributed systems. |
| Engineering Leadership | Driving technical direction, mentoring teams, and communicating with clarity. |
| Continuous Growth | Experimenting, building open-source utilities, and documenting lessons learned. |

## Core Topics

### 1. Advanced Java & JVM Internals
- Garbage collectors: G1, ZGC, Shenandoah  
- Escape analysis, JIT optimizations, stack vs heap allocation  
- Memory model, false sharing, and cache coherence  
- Virtual threads (Project Loom), structured concurrency  
- Non-blocking I/O, reactive programming, ForkJoinPool  
- Profiling and benchmarking: JMH, async-profiler, JFR

### 2. Systems Design & Architecture
- Scalability and high availability: sharding, partitioning, replication  
- API design at scale: versioning, schema evolution, GraphQL vs REST  
- Event-driven architecture: Kafka, event sourcing, CQRS  
- Observability: tracing, metrics, logs, SLOs, error budgets  
- Cloud-native architecture: containerization, autoscaling, fault tolerance  
- Security by design: OAuth2, JWT, secrets management

### 3. Performance & Optimization
- CPU vs I/O bottleneck analysis  
- GC tuning and memory leak diagnosis  
- Throughput vs latency trade-offs  
- Caching strategies (local, distributed, write-through, write-behind)  
- Lock-free algorithms, batching, backpressure  
- Low-latency design for high-load systems

### 4. Distributed Systems & Infrastructure
- Consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos), leader election  
- Data consistency models, CAP theorem, vector clocks  
- Networking internals: TCP, congestion control, TLS handshake  
- Databases: indexing, transactions, replication, isolation levels  
- Cloud foundations: AWS architecture, autoscaling, VPC, S3, DynamoDB  
- Container internals: namespaces, cgroups, build optimization

### 5. Leadership & Influence
- Writing clear design docs and ADRs  
- Mentoring and technical coaching  
- Driving architecture reviews across teams  
- Managing risk, trade-offs, and technical debt  
- Communicating complexity simply — from engineers to executives  
- Shaping long-term technical strategy and culture

## Learning Philosophy

1. Depth over breadth — understand the “why”, not just the “how”.  
2. Code everything — practical exploration > passive reading.  
3. Document & share — clarity comes from explaining.  
4. Automate experiments — measure, benchmark, and visualize.  
5. Iterate publicly — treat this repo as an evolving technical journal.
